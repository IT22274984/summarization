End-to-End News Summarization and Analysis System
End-to-End News Summarization and Analysis System
Aug 2024 - Oct 2024Aug 2024 - Oct 2024
🌟 Project Overview
In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, the overwhelming volume of news articles calls for efficient summarization and analysis solutions. As part of this project, I developed an End-to-End News Summarization and Analysis System using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Model (LLM) techniques. This system aims to simplify information consumption by generating concise summaries and providing insightful analysis of news content.

🔍 Key Features

Extractive Summarization: Identifies and combines key sentences from the article.
Abstractive Summarization: Utilizes a fine-tuned T5 transformer model to generate human-like, concise summaries.
Sentiment Analysis: Assesses the emotional tone of articles using NLTK's VADER model.
Keyword Extraction: Highlights important terms using TF-IDF vectorization.
Topic Modeling: Identifies broader themes with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: Built an interactive user interface with Streamlit, allowing dynamic input and real-time results.
Backend: Implemented in Python, leveraging Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, and ROUGE metrics for evaluation.
Data Analysis: Used Pandas, NumPy, and other libraries for processing and analyzing the CNN/DailyMail News Dataset.
📈 Outcome
This system demonstrates a robust framework for summarizing and analyzing news articles, offering valuable potential for applications in information retrieval and content analysis. While it has limitations in processing extremely long texts, it serves as a foundation for future improvements such as enhanced scalability, real-time visualizations, and cloud deployment.

💡 What I Learned
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing, Large Language model (LLM) fine-tuning, and building interactive web applications. It also deepened my understanding of combining technical and user-centric design.
